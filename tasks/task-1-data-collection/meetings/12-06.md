# Data Collection's meeting minutes: 12th of June, 2023

## Meeting ideas:
* Maybe we should have groups specialized in each "topic": one for weather forecasting and another for the traffic congestion. This would speed up work, as things would be more focused and people can work on what they find more interesting
    * Consider doing a poll to see which "topic" people prefer
* Combining multiple sources of data. This could give our model a higher ceiling, and make for an interesting feature engineering step but it can be hard to do.
* Focus search on the SEA (SouthEast Asia) region, and not on specific countries. We don't exactly know which country will be selected, so to avoid wasted effort this is the safe bet.
    * If we find good data on one specific country, we can push for it to be included on the selected 3, though.

## Data sources to consider:
## [meteoblue](https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/archive/export/south-east-asia_vietnam_6942000) (Weather forecasting service)
Pros:
* Has data specific to SEA
* Easy to access and to work with (has a bunch of useful attributes in one place)


Cons:
* Limited amount of data (1.5 years)

## [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) (Satellite)
Pros:
* A lot of data publicly available


Cons:
* Hard to work with. There is so much stuff that it's easy to get overwhelmed when you don't know what you're doing (we probably don't)
* Will have to manually filter SEA data

## [Sentinel](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/access-to-sentinel-data-via-the-copernicus-data-space-ecosystem) (Satellite)
Pros:
* A lot of data publicly available
* Has information on emergencies (floods, fires, ..) that could be useful


Cons:
* Hard to work with
* Will have to manually filter SEA data

## [Myanmar Climate Data Portal](http://dmh-cdp.wowspace.org/team/homex.php)
Pros:
* Myanmar specific data on the Myanmar Local Chapter
* Incredibly specific


Cons:
* Data only until 2014
* Seemingly inaccessible (have to create account, but can't create account)
* Single country

## Inspiration?:
[Short and Long-term Pattern Discovery Over Large-Scale Geo-Spatiotemporal Data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3292500.3330755): Paper where a guy combines weather and traffic data and tries to relate them in some way. The process to identify [weather](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/lstw#weather-events)/[traffic](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/lstw#traffic-events) events can be useful.

## Extra:
Contacted some orgs to see if they can provide anything useful data. No response yet.

## What to do next? (Suggestions)
Find data for the traffic congestion topic
Try to access, download, view the data on the mentioned datasets
Maybe check out if NASA has something interesting?
