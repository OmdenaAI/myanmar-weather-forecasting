# Data Collection's meeting minutes: 17th of June, 2023

## Meeting ideas:
* Probably drop the NOAA dataset, as it's really hard to work with.
* Need to concentrate our efforts in trying to find something for the traffic problem. This kind of information on SEA looks hard to find.
    * Biggest lead was something like google/bing maps, but they don't provide historical data
    * Maybe consider changing the scope?

## Data sources to consider:
## [open-meteo's Historical Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api)
Pros:
* Up-to date data from satellites
* Easy to access via the API
* Can get data from anywhere in the world


Cons:
* Data seems to be from a single point, not an area

## What to do next? (Suggestions)
* Find data for the traffic congestion topic (asap)
* Define what we want to do for the traffic problem, as this could help narrow down search for data.
