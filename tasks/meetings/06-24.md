# General meeting minutes: 24th of June, 2023

## Meeting ideas:
* The SEA countries will be from the following list:
    * Philippines
    * Singapore
    * Indonesia
    * Myanmar
* An insightful EDA for the traffic congestion problem will be difficult, as we're dealing with object detection, meaning our data is mostly images.
    * Maybe we could do an additional data collection step to gather information on the traffic situation on SEA. This would give the EDA team more to work with.

## Updates
### Data Collection
* Found an interesting dataset for the traffic problem: [Car Object Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection)
    * Not specific from SEA, but cars are something that don't change all that much from country to country.
    * Images taken at the side of the road
        * Not exactly the most similar to traffic cameras, but similar enough for us to get started
    * Annotated with bounding boxes
    * Data collection code will be merged soon

* Found two more sources of weather data: [Berkley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/data/) and [Visual Crossing's Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api)

## Extra
* There's an example on how to clone the repository and run the script to download data in the meeting recordings
