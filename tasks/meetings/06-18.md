# General meeting minutes: 18th of June, 2023

## Meeting ideas:
* Weather forecasting
    * **Create a model that predicts temperature, wind and rain**
    * Create another model that uses temperature, wind and rain information and classifies it as dangerous or not
* Traffic congestion
    * **Work with images (something like detecting cars)**
        * Fine tune to SEA region
    * Work with expected travel time from something like google maps API
        * High traffic = increased expected travel time in the main routes of a city
        * Find out main routes (by consulting the locals, for example)

## Updates
### Data Collection
* Found an interesting dataset to the weather forecasting problem: [meteo-blue](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api)
    * For now, the data comes from a single point in the globe (Myanmar coordinates, 21°N, 96°E)
      * Maybe we could sample various points from Myanmar or SEA
    * Attribute meanings can be found on the link above
    * Collects data from the [Copernicus satellites](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)
    * **Data preprocessing and EDA teams** can start working
    * To download, run the `open_meteo.py` script at [`src/weather/data`](../../src/weather/data)
* Not much luck on the traffic congestion front
    * Hard to find this information, especially for the SEA region
